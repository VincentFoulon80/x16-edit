# x16-edit

Text editor for Commander X16

X16 Edit is a simple text editor for the Commander X16 platform inspired by GNU Nano but lacking some of its more advanced functions such as soft line breaks.

The program is written in 65c02 assembly.

Text entered by the user is stored in banked RAM, and it will fit nearly 2 MB of actual text.
